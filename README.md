# Job-Portal-for-Specially-Abled-Students
Students with disabilities are often unable to prove their abilities during placement procedures or land a job. The AI-driven employment platform provides a user-friendly, personalized solution that matches the unique requirements of every student with the hiring process. The software enables successful interaction for all users by integrating multimodal communication, such as visual interfaces for deaf people and voice interfaces for those with visual impairments. By integrating cutting-edge AI methods like deep learning and natural language processing (NLP), it offers customized user experiences and gives companies best practices for inclusive hiring. By empowering impaired students to negotiate the labor market with greater efficacy and confidence, the platform hopes to close the employment gap.
